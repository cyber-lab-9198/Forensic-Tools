# Usage Guide

This guide describes the active `FORENSICS_DISCORD` product shape: a **terminal-only, portable Windows 11 bundle**.

## Product model

- no GUI launcher
- no frontend web report
- no Windows installer
- no mandatory installation path
- portable execution from any extracted or cloned folder

The supported end-user shells are:

- `cmd`
- PowerShell

## Requirements

### Public portable bundle

- Windows 11 64-bit
- no separate Python or Node.js installation required
- Administrator approval only when the forensic workflow needs elevation during collection

### Private source workspace

- Windows 11 64-bit
- Python `3.10+`
- Administrator access when elevated collection is required

## Running from a portable release

After downloading a GitHub release zip or cloning the bundle-only public repository, extract it to any drive and run:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd --help
.\fdctl.cmd apps detect
.\launch-analysis-terminal.cmd
```

Direct PowerShell usage also works:

```powershell
.\fdctl.ps1 --help
.\fdctl.ps1 license status
```

## Default storage behavior

The portable bundle stores case data beside the portable folder by default:

```text
.\workspace
```

Saved cases are stored under:

```text
.\workspace\cases\<case-id>
```

Runtime cases are stored under:

```text
.\workspace\runtime\<case-id>
```

### Override the case root

If you want to store forensic data on another drive:

```powershell
$env:FDCTL_DATA_ROOT="E:\DFIR_CASES"
.\fdctl.cmd apps detect
```

## Licensing

### Built-in trial

- starts after the user enters an email address
- valid for `3 days`
- only accepts Gmail addresses ending with `@gmail.com`
- bound to the first Gmail address that uses the tool on that device
- stored under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\FORENSICS_DISCORD\license`
- local masked email/license history is also stored there so returning users can re-enter only their Gmail address when a valid local trial or activation already exists

That means one installed device only gets one free-trial Gmail identity. A second new Gmail address on the same device will be asked for a paid key instead of receiving another free trial.

### Owner-only access

The public client bundle does not contain any hard-coded owner master key.

- the owner should use a separately issued signed owner key kept outside the public bundle
- the owner key is generated only from the private source workspace
- the owner key is separate from customer-issued time-limited keys
- the public bundle only contains the public verification key, not the signing secret

### Activation after trial

Check status:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd license status
```

Activate by pasting a key:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd license activate --prompt
```

Or activate from a file:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd license activate --email user@gmail.com --key-file .\issued_30d.key
```

Activation succeeds only when the entered Gmail address matches the `issuedToEmail` value embedded in the signed key.
Issued keys are exported in grouped letters-only format, for example `ABCD-EFGH-JKLM-NPQR-...`.
Customer keys are issued for one Gmail address and one target device fingerprint.

### Guided activation in the terminal workflow

End users do not need to run the activation command manually if they use the guided launcher:

```powershell
.\launch-analysis-terminal.cmd
```

When the built-in 3-day trial for that device Gmail has expired, the workflow will prompt for:

- licensed email address
- issued license key

If that Gmail address already has a valid local trial or a valid activated key on the same device, the workflow will accept the email verification and continue without asking the user to paste the key again.

If the email does not match the email identity encoded in the key, activation is rejected.

Deactivate the local activation:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd license deactivate
```

Supported issued license types:

- `issued_7d`
- `issued_30d`
- `issued_365d`

Private source workspaces can also issue an owner-only unlimited key for the registered owner account.

### Issuing a customer key for one device

End users should send the machine fingerprint shown in their activation request. Then issue the key from the private source workspace:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd license issue --email user@gmail.com --type issued_30d --machine "<fingerprint-from-user>" --out ".\user_30d.key"
```

End users can print their device name and machine fingerprint with:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd license machine
```

If `--out` is omitted, the key is stored automatically in:

```text
D:\LICENSE TOOL FORENSIC
```

## Core commands

Detect supported applications:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd apps detect
```

Create a new case:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd case create --app discord --id discord_case_001
```

Create a scoped case:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd case create --app discord --id discord_case_001 --channel-url "https://discord.gg/example" --target-user "mavanvo2472"
```

Collect artifacts:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd collect --case discord_case_001
```

Analyze a case:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd analyze --case discord_case_001
```

Run supplemental completeness checks:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd supplement --case discord_case_001
```

Build the report bundle:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd report build --case discord_case_001
```

Open a terminal summary of the report:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd report open --case discord_case_001
```

Save the case:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd case save --case discord_case_001
```

Discard the case:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd case discard --case discord_case_001
```

Run the guided investigation workflow:

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd menu --app discord
```

Or launch the guided terminal directly:

```powershell
.\launch-analysis-terminal.cmd
```

## End-to-end example

```powershell
.\fdctl.cmd case create --app discord --id discord_case_demo --channel-url "https://discord.gg/example" --target-user "mavanvo2472"
.\fdctl.cmd collect --case discord_case_demo
.\fdctl.cmd analyze --case discord_case_demo
.\fdctl.cmd supplement --case discord_case_demo
.\fdctl.cmd report build --case discord_case_demo
.\fdctl.cmd report open --case discord_case_demo
.\fdctl.cmd case save --case discord_case_demo
```

## Report outputs

The report is written entirely inside the saved case.

Most important files:

- `08_Report\Muc_luc_bao_cao.md`
- `08_Report\Bien_ban_ban_giao.md`
- `08_Report\case_snapshot.json`
- `08_Report\validation_summary.json`

Other key evidence remains in:

- `07_Exports\*.csv`
- `05_Autopsy_Case\`
- `01_Case_Info\`

## Internal build workflow

Build the portable bundle from the private source workspace:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-package.ps1
```

Outputs:

```text
.\dist\FORENSICS_DISCORD
.\dist\github-release
.\dist\FORENSICS_DISCORD_portable.zip
```

## Notes

- Discord is the primary supported target.
- Zalo remains a placeholder in the current build.
- Firefox collection is not part of the active pipeline.
- `05_Autopsy_Case` is an Autopsy-ready export bundle, not a native Autopsy project database.
